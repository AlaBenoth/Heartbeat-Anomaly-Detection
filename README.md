# Heartbeat-Anomaly-Detection
In this project, we have used a python autoencoder based on the LSTM or Long Short Term Memory algorithm.
LSTM is a Deep Recurrent Neural Network algorithm.
The aim of the project is to get the dataset of the ECG data and split it into anomaly heartbeat types and normal ones.
